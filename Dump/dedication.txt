Dedication

This thesis is dedicated to my father, who taught me that the best kind of knowledge to have is that which is learned for its own sake. It is also dedicated to my mother, who taught me that even the largest task can be accomplished if it is done one step at a time.
This paper is dedicated my mother who have always been supportive and proud of her sonsâ€™ achievements. We miss you. This is also dedicated to my loving wife Deryl who have always been encouraging and kept pushing me forward. My kids Dean, Dan and Daena have been my source of inspiration in completing the program. Lastly, to my dad who always have my back, I am deeply indebted. Thank you.
