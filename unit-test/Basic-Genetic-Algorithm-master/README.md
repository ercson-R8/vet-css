Description
==============

This is a basic PHP genetic algorithm I made some time ago to just play with the concept.

The purpose is to start with a random string and applying genetic operators arrive to a target string.

The target string is setted in the file index.php.

Usage
=======

Just open a command line, navigate to the folder and run the index.php
